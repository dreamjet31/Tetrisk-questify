## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── action.js
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── useInterval.js
│   │   └── useWindowDimensions.js
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── Home/
│   │   |   └── index.tsx
│   │   ├── StartGame/
|   │   |   └── index.tsx
│   │   ├── Tetris/
|   │   |   └── index.tsx
│   ├── redux/
│   │   ├── slices/
|   │   |   └── index.tsx
|   |   ├── store.ts
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
